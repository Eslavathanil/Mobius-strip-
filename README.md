1. Code Structure
Class-based (MobiusStrip) for reusability and modular design.

Key methods:

_generate_surface: Uses the parametric equation to generate (x, y, z) mesh.

compute_surface_area: Uses numerical integration (|r_u Ã— r_v| du dv) to compute area.

compute_edge_length: Calculates arc length along the boundary path.

plot: Generates a 3D visualization with matplotlib.

2. Surface Area Approximation
Calculated the cross product of partial derivatives w.r.t. u and v.

Computed the norm |r_u Ã— r_v| for every grid cell and integrated with du * dv.

3. Challenges
Approximating surface area numerically is sensitive to resolution (n). Low values can under-approximate area.

The MÃ¶bius strip is non-orientable, but since we're using one-sided parametric coverage (with a twist), integration and visualization work correctly.
